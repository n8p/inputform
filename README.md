# Basic input form using AJAX

This is a very simple input form that utilizes user input, AJAX, and form validation/sanitization.

Demo purposes only.

## Install

Simply drop into the main docroot of your webserver. Requires PHP.

## Notes

Dependencies would be better off implemented with a package manager, but I have kept them inline for demo simplicity.
